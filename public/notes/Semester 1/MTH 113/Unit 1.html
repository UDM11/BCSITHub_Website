    <h1>Unit 1: Basic Concept</h1>

    <div class="section">
        <h2>1.1 Elementary Logic</h2>
        <p>Elementary logic is the foundation of reasoning, used to construct and evaluate arguments systematically, particularly in mathematics and computer science.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Propositions:</strong> Statements that are either true or false (e.g., “2 + 2 = 4” is true; “2 + 2 = 5” is false). Non-propositional statements, like questions, are excluded.</li>
            <li><strong>Logical Arguments:</strong> Consist of premises (given statements) leading to a conclusion. An argument is valid if the conclusion follows logically from the premises.</li>
            <li><strong>Truth Values:</strong> Propositions are evaluated as true (T) or false (F), forming the basis for logical operations and proofs.</li>
            <li><strong>Applications:</strong> Used in programming (e.g., Boolean logic in conditionals), mathematics, and decision-making to ensure consistent reasoning.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Elementary logic provides tools to analyze and construct valid arguments, essential for problem-solving.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
        <h2>1.2 Connectives, Quantifiers</h2>
        <p>Logical connectives and quantifiers are tools to combine propositions and express relationships, forming the basis of complex logical statements.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Connectives:</strong> Include AND (conjunction, ∧), OR (disjunction, ∨), NOT (negation, ¬), IMPLIES (implication, →), and IF AND ONLY IF (biconditional, ↔). For example, “p ∧ q” is true only if both p and q are true.</li>
            <li><strong>Truth Tables:</strong> Used to evaluate connectives by listing all possible truth values (e.g., for p → q, the statement is false only when p is true and q is false).</li>
            <li><strong>Quantifiers:</strong> Express scope of variables. Universal quantifier (∀, “for all”) applies to every element (e.g., ∀x (x > 0)), while existential quantifier (∃, “there exists”) applies to at least one (e.g., ∃x (x² = 4)).</li>
            <li><strong>Applications:</strong> Connectives and quantifiers are used in programming logic, database queries, and mathematical proofs to define conditions and relationships.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>These tools enable precise formulation of logical expressions in reasoning and computation.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
        <h2>1.3 Basic Laws of Logic</h2>
        <p>Basic laws of logic govern how propositions and connectives interact, ensuring consistent and valid reasoning in mathematical and computational contexts.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Commutative Law:</strong> Order doesn’t matter in AND or OR operations (e.g., p ∧ q = q ∧ p; p ∨ q = q ∨ p).</li>
            <li><strong>Associative Law:</strong> Grouping doesn’t affect AND or OR (e.g., (p ∧ q) ∧ r = p ∧ (q ∧ r)).</li>
            <li><strong>Distributive Law:</strong> AND and OR distribute over each other (e.g., p ∧ (q ∨ r) = (p ∧ q) ∨ (p ∧ r)).</li>
            <li><strong>De Morgan’s Laws:</strong> Negation of conjunctions and disjunctions: ¬(p ∧ q) = ¬p ∨ ¬q; ¬(p ∨ q) = ¬p ∧ ¬q. These are critical for simplifying logical expressions.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>These laws ensure logical equivalence and simplify complex expressions in proofs and algorithms.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
        <h2>1.4 Quantifiers</h2>
        <p>Quantifiers specify the scope of variables in logical statements, crucial for precise mathematical and computational reasoning.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Universal Quantifier (∀):</strong> Indicates a statement is true for all elements in a set (e.g., ∀x ∈ ℝ (x² ≥ 0) means “for all real numbers x, x² is non-negative”).</li>
            <li><strong>Existential Quantifier (∃):</strong> Indicates a statement is true for at least one element (e.g., ∃x ∈ ℝ (x² = 9) means “there exists a real number x such that x² = 9”).</li>
            <li><strong>Negation of Quantifiers:</strong> Negating a universal quantifier yields an existential one, and vice versa (e.g., ¬∀x P(x) = ∃x ¬P(x)).</li>
            <li><strong>Applications:</strong> Used in formal specifications, database queries (e.g., SQL), and proofs to define conditions over sets or domains.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Quantifiers enable precise expression of generalizations and existence in logical arguments.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
        <h2>1.5 Techniques of Proof</h2>
        <p>Techniques of proof are methods to establish the truth of mathematical statements, widely used in logic, mathematics, and computer science.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Direct Proof:</strong> Assume premises are true and logically derive the conclusion (e.g., prove “if n is even, then n² is even” by showing n = 2k implies n² = 4k²).</li>
            <li><strong>Proof by Contradiction:</strong> Assume the opposite of the conclusion, derive a contradiction (e.g., to prove √2 is irrational, assume it’s rational and show it leads to a contradiction).</li>
            <li><strong>Mathematical Induction:</strong> Prove a statement for a base case and show it holds for the next case (e.g., prove Σn = n(n+1)/2 for all n ≥ 1).</li>
            <li><strong>Counterexample:</strong> Disprove a universal statement by providing a single example where it fails (e.g., “all primes are odd” is disproved by n = 2).</li>
        </ul>
        <p>These techniques ensure rigorous validation of claims in theoretical and applied fields.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
        <h2>1.6 Sets, Types of Sets, Venn Diagram</h2>
        <p>Sets are collections of distinct elements, fundamental to mathematics and computer science, with Venn diagrams visually representing relationships.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Sets:</strong> Defined by elements (e.g., A = {1, 2, 3}) or properties (e.g., {x | x is even}). Notation includes ∈ for membership (e.g., 2 ∈ A).</li>
            <li><strong>Types of Sets:</strong> Include empty set (∅), finite sets (e.g., {1, 2}), infinite sets (e.g., ℕ), universal set (all elements in context), and subsets (B ⊆ A if all elements of B are in A).</li>
            <li><strong>Venn Diagrams:</strong> Use circles to represent sets and their relationships, such as intersections (shared elements) or unions (all elements). For example, two overlapping circles show A ∩ B.</li>
            <li><strong>Applications:</strong> Sets are used in databases, programming (e.g., sets in Python), and logic to organize and analyze data.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Sets and Venn diagrams provide a framework for understanding relationships and structures.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
        <h2>1.7 Set Operations, Laws of the Algebra of Sets</h2>
        <p>Set operations manipulate sets to form new ones, governed by algebraic laws, essential for data analysis and logical reasoning.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Operations:</strong> Union (A ∪ B: all elements in A or B), intersection (A ∩ B: elements in both A and B), difference (A \ B: elements in A but not B), and complement (A’: elements not in A).</li>
            <li><strong>Commutative Law:</strong> A ∪ B = B ∪ A; A ∩ B = B ∩ A.</li>
            <li><strong>Associative Law:</strong> (A ∪ B) ∪ C = A ∪ (B ∪ C); (A ∩ B) ∩ C = A ∩ (B ∩ C).</li>
            <li><strong>De Morgan’s Laws for Sets:</strong> (A ∪ B)’ = A’ ∩ B’; (A ∩ B)’ = A’ ∪ B’. These simplify set expressions and are used in programming and database queries.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Set operations and laws enable efficient manipulation and analysis of data collections.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
        <h2>1.8 Real Number System, Representation on the Real Line</h2>
        <p>The real number system encompasses all numbers on the number line, used extensively in mathematics and computing for measurements and calculations.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Real Numbers:</strong> Include integers, rational numbers (e.g., 1/2), and irrational numbers (e.g., √2, π), forming a complete, ordered system.</li>
            <li><strong>Real Line Representation:</strong> Each real number corresponds to a unique point on an infinite line, with 0 as the origin, positive numbers to the right, and negative to the left.</li>
            <li><strong>Subsets:</strong> Naturals (ℕ: 1, 2, …), integers (ℤ: …, -1, 0, 1, …), rationals (ℚ: fractions), and irrationals (non-repeating decimals).</li>
            <li><strong>Applications:</strong> Real numbers are used in algorithms, data modeling, and graphical representations in programming and engineering.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>The real number system and its visual representation provide a foundation for quantitative analysis.</p>

    <div class="section">
        <h2>1.9 Properties of Real Numbers, Ordered Sets, Inequalities</h2>
        <p>Properties of real numbers and their ordering underpin mathematical operations and comparisons, critical for logical and computational tasks.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Properties:</strong> Commutative (a + b = b + a), associative ((a + b) + c = a + (b + c)), distributive (a(b + c) = ab + ac), and identity (a + 0 = a; a × 1 = a).</li>
            <li><strong>Ordered Sets:</strong> Real numbers are totally ordered; for any a, b, either a < b, a = b, or a > b, enabling consistent comparisons.</li>
            <li><strong>Inequalities:</strong> Express relationships like a ≤ b or a > b. Properties include transitivity (if a < b and b < c, then a < c) and addition (if a < b, then a + c < b + c).</li>
            <li><strong>Applications:</strong> Used in optimization problems, algorithm design, and data sorting to establish relationships and constraints.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>1.10 Intervals, Absolute Value, Cartesian Product, Relation</h2>
        <p>Intervals, absolute values, Cartesian products, and relations are key concepts for defining ranges, distances, and relationships in mathematics and computer science.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Intervals:</strong> Subsets of real numbers, e.g., closed [a, b] (includes a, b), open (a, b) (excludes a, b). Used to define ranges in programming and analysis.</li>
            <li><strong>Absolute Value:</strong> |x| represents the distance from x to 0 (e.g., |-3| = 3). Used in error calculations and optimization algorithms.</li>
