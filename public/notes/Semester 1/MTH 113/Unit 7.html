    <h1>Unit 7: Permutations and Combinations</h1>

    <div class="section">
        <h2>7.1 Basic Principles of Counting, Factorial Notation</h2>
        <p>The basic principles of counting provide a foundation for calculating the number of possible outcomes in combinatorial problems, with factorial notation as a key tool.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Fundamental Counting Principle:</strong> If one event can occur in m ways and a second event in n ways, the total number of ways both events can occur is m × n. Example: Choosing a shirt (3 options) and pants (4 options) yields 3 × 4 = 12 outfits.</li>
            <li><strong>Addition Principle:</strong> If an event can occur in m ways or another in n ways, and the ways are mutually exclusive, the total is m + n. Example: Choosing a red (3 options) or blue (2 options) shirt yields 3 + 2 = 5 choices.</li>
            <li><strong>Factorial Notation:</strong> For a positive integer n, n! (n factorial) is the product of all positive integers up to n (e.g., 5! = 5 × 4 × 3 × 2 × 1 = 120). By definition, 0! = 1.</li>
            <li><strong>Applications:</strong> Used in probability, computer science (e.g., algorithm complexity), and statistics to count possible arrangements or selections.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>These principles enable systematic counting of outcomes in complex scenarios.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
        <h2>7.2 Permutation, Permutation of Objects Alike</h2>
        <p>Permutations deal with the arrangement of objects where order matters, including cases where some objects are identical.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Permutation:</strong> The number of ways to arrange n distinct objects is n!. Example: Arranging 3 letters (A, B, C) yields 3! = 6 arrangements (ABC, ACB, BAC, etc.).</li>
            <li><strong>Permutation of r Objects from n:</strong> The number of ways to arrange r objects from n distinct objects is P(n,r) = n!/(n-r)!. Example: Arranging 2 out of 4 letters (A, B, C, D) gives P(4,2) = 4!/(4-2)! = 12.</li>
            <li><strong>Permutation of Objects Alike:</strong> For n objects where n₁ are of one type, n₂ of another, etc., the number of distinct arrangements is n!/(n₁!·n₂!·…). Example: Arranging letters in “BOOK” (2 O’s, 1 B, 1 K) gives 4!/(2!·1!·1!) = 24/2 = 12.</li>
            <li><strong>Applications:</strong> Used in scheduling, password generation, and combinatorial design in computer science and operations research.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Permutations account for order-sensitive arrangements, critical for precise counting.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
        <h2>7.3 Permutation with Restrictions, Circular Permutation</h2>
        <p>Permutations with restrictions and circular permutations address specific constraints or arrangements, common in real-world problems.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Permutations with Restrictions:</strong> Count arrangements with conditions, such as certain objects being together or apart. Example: Arranging 3 people (A, B, C) with A and B together is calculated by treating A and B as one unit: 2! (for the unit and C) × 2! (for A, B within the unit) = 4.</li>
            <li><strong>Approach for Restrictions:</strong> First satisfy the restriction (e.g., group objects), then arrange remaining elements using standard permutation formulas.</li>
            <li><strong>Circular Permutation:</strong> For n distinct objects arranged in a circle, the number of distinct arrangements is (n-1)!, as rotations are considered identical. Example: Seating 4 people around a table gives (4-1)! = 3! = 6 arrangements.</li>
            <li><strong>Applications:</strong> Used in seating arrangements, network topology design, and scheduling problems where constraints or circularity apply.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>These concepts handle specialized arrangement problems with practical relevance.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
        <h2>7.4 Combination, Combination with Restrictions</h2>
        <p>Combinations focus on selecting objects where order does not matter, including cases with specific constraints.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Combination:</strong> The number of ways to choose r objects from n distinct objects is C(n,r) = n!/(r!(n-r)!), also denoted as “n choose r.” Example: Choosing 2 out of 4 items (A, B, C, D) gives C(4,2) = 4!/(2!·2!) = 6 (AB, AC, AD, BC, BD, CD).</li>
            <li><strong>Properties:</strong> C(n,r) = C(n,n-r); C(n,0) = C(n,n) = 1. Combinations are used when arrangement is irrelevant, unlike permutations.</li>
            <li><strong>Combination with Restrictions:</strong> Address conditions like including or excluding specific objects. Example: Choosing 3 items from 5 (A, B, C, D, E) with A included reduces to choosing 2 more from 4: C(4,2) = 6.</li>
            <li><strong>Applications:</strong> Used in probability (e.g., lottery odds), data science (e.g., feature selection), and team formation where order is irrelevant.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Combinations simplify counting selections in diverse theoretical and applied contexts.</p>
