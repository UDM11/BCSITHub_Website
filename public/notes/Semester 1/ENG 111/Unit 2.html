        <ul>
            <li><strong>Conversational English:</strong> Everyday interactions, such as casual discussions or workplace conversations, require attentiveness to informal language, slang, and varying speech paces.</li>
            <li><strong>Professional Contexts:</strong> Meetings, interviews, and client interactions demand comprehension of formal language, industry-specific jargon, and polite discourse to ensure clarity and respect.</li>
            <li><strong>Cultural Nuances:</strong> Spoken English varies by region and culture, with differences in accents, idioms, and expressions. Understanding these enhances cross-cultural communication.</li>
            <li><strong>Media and Public Speaking:</strong> Listening to podcasts, webinars, or speeches involves grasping main ideas, tone, and intent, often under time constraints or with background noise.</li>
