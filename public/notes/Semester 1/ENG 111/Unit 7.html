        <h2>7.1 Grammar and Vocabulary</h2>
        <p>Effective writing relies on strong grammar and a robust vocabulary to ensure clarity, precision, and professionalism, particularly in academic and IT contexts.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Grammar Fundamentals:</strong> Use correct sentence structure, punctuation, and agreement (e.g., subject-verb agreement) to convey ideas clearly and avoid misinterpretation.</li>
            <li><strong>Vocabulary Choice:</strong> Select precise, context-appropriate words (e.g., “optimize” instead of “improve” in technical writing) to enhance clarity and credibility.</li>
            <li><strong>Avoiding Common Errors:</strong> Watch for issues like misplaced modifiers or incorrect pronoun use, which can confuse readers, especially in technical documents.</li>
            <li><strong>Building Vocabulary:</strong> Read widely, use glossaries for technical terms, and practice incorporating new words to improve expression and adaptability in writing.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Mastering grammar and vocabulary ensures polished, effective communication in professional settings.</p>

        <ul>
            <li><strong>Sentence Structure:</strong> Vary sentence types (simple, compound, complex) to maintain reader interest and clarity (e.g., “The system crashed; however, the team implemented a backup solution”).</li>
            <li><strong>Writing Papers:</strong> Academic papers require clear thesis statements, logical paragraph organization, and evidence-based arguments, using formal language and consistent structure.</li>
            <li><strong>Technical Documents:</strong> Focus on precision and conciseness in documents like user manuals or system specifications, using headings, bullet points, and diagrams for accessibility.</li>
            <li><strong>Coherence and Flow:</strong> Use transitions and parallel structure to connect ideas, ensuring smooth progression in both academic and technical writing.</li>

            <li><strong>Structure:</strong> Include sections like an executive summary, introduction, methodology, findings, and recommendations, tailored to the audience’s needs (e.g., managers or clients).</li>
            <li><strong>Clarity and Conciseness:</strong> Present data or technical details (e.g., system performance metrics) clearly, using tables or graphs to support findings without overwhelming detail.</li>
            <li><strong>Objective Tone:</strong> Maintain neutrality, focusing on facts and actionable insights, avoiding personal opinions unless explicitly required.</li>

        <ul>
            <li><strong>Email Structure:</strong> Use a clear subject line, formal greeting, concise body, and professional closing. Tailor tone to the recipient (e.g., formal for clients, semi-formal for colleagues).</li>
