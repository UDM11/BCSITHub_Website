    <div class="section">
        <h2>4.1 Academic and Non-Academic Language; Pronoun Usage</h2>
        <p>Understanding the distinction between academic and non-academic language, along with proper pronoun usage, is essential for clear and professional communication, particularly in IT-related writing.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Academic Language:</strong> Formal, objective, and precise, academic language avoids colloquialisms and uses technical terms appropriately, suitable for reports, research papers, and professional correspondence.</li>
            <li><strong>Non-Academic Language:</strong> Informal and conversational, this style includes slang or personal tone, often used in casual emails or social media but less appropriate for professional documents.</li>
            <li><strong>Pronoun Usage:</strong> Pronouns (e.g., he, she, it, they) replace nouns to avoid repetition. In academic writing, use pronouns consistently and clearly to maintain coherence and avoid ambiguity.</li>
            <li><strong>Clarity in Pronouns:</strong> Ensure pronouns have clear antecedents (e.g., “The server failed, and it caused delays” clearly links “it” to “server”). Avoid vague pronouns in formal writing.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Mastering these distinctions enhances professionalism and clarity in both academic and workplace communication.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
        <h2>4.2 Understanding Different Types of Pronouns and Their Usage in Academic Writing</h2>
        <p>Pronouns play a critical role in academic writing, ensuring clarity and conciseness. Different types of pronouns serve specific functions and must be used accurately.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Personal Pronouns:</strong> Include I, you, he, she, it, we, they. In academic writing, limit first-person pronouns (I, we) to maintain objectivity, unless expressing personal analysis.</li>
            <li><strong>Possessive Pronouns:</strong> Such as mine, yours, his, hers, theirs, show ownership (e.g., “This algorithm is theirs”). Use them to avoid repetitive noun use.</li>
            <li><strong>Relative Pronouns:</strong> Who, whom, which, that introduce clauses (e.g., “The system that crashed needs updates”). Choose “who” for people and “which” or “that” for objects.</li>
            <li><strong>Indefinite Pronouns:</strong> Such as anyone, something, refer to non-specific entities. Use sparingly in academic writing to maintain precision (e.g., “Someone accessed the database” may need clarification).</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Proper pronoun use ensures clarity, reduces redundancy, and maintains a formal tone in academic texts.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
        <h2>4.3 Understanding the Different Verb Tenses and Their Usage in Academic Writing</h2>
        <p>Verb tenses convey the timing of actions and are critical for clarity in academic writing, particularly when discussing research, processes, or findings.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Present Tense:</strong> Used for general facts, current states, or ongoing research (e.g., “This algorithm improves efficiency”). Common in abstracts and discussions.</li>
            <li><strong>Past Tense:</strong> Describes completed actions or past research (e.g., “The experiment yielded significant results”). Used in methodology and results sections.</li>
            <li><strong>Future Tense:</strong> Indicates anticipated outcomes or future work (e.g., “This study will explore new frameworks”). Used in proposals or conclusions.</li>
            <li><strong>Perfect Tenses:</strong> Present perfect (e.g., “Studies have shown”) connects past actions to the present, while past perfect (e.g., “The team had tested the system”) clarifies sequence in past events.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Choosing the appropriate tense ensures temporal accuracy and aligns with the purpose of each section in academic writing.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
        <h2>4.4 Subject and Verb Agreement</h2>
        <p>Subject-verb agreement ensures that the subject and verb in a sentence align in number (singular or plural), maintaining grammatical accuracy and clarity.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Singular Subjects:</strong> Require singular verbs (e.g., “The programmer writes clean code”). Use “is” or “has” for singular subjects.</li>
            <li><strong>Plural Subjects:</strong> Require plural verbs (e.g., “The programmers write clean code”). Use “are” or “have” for plural subjects.</li>
            <li><strong>Complex Subjects:</strong> With compound subjects joined by “and,” use plural verbs (e.g., “The server and database are operational”). For subjects joined by “or,” the verb agrees with the closest subject.</li>
            <li><strong>Indefinite Pronouns:</strong> Singular pronouns like “everyone” take singular verbs (e.g., “Everyone is responsible”), while “all” or “some” may take plural verbs depending on context.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Correct agreement enhances readability and professionalism in technical and academic writing.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
        <h2>4.5 Maintaining Consistency in Verb Tense Throughout a Written Work</h2>
        <p>Consistency in verb tense ensures coherence and prevents confusion in academic and professional writing, maintaining a logical flow of ideas.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Single Tense for Single Sections:</strong> Use one tense within a paragraph or section unless a shift is justified (e.g., use past tense consistently in a methodology section).</li>
            <li><strong>Logical Shifts:</strong> Shift tenses only to reflect changes in time (e.g., past tense for completed experiments, present tense for current implications).</li>
            <li><strong>Review and Edit:</strong> Check for unintended tense shifts during revision, ensuring alignment with the narrative’s timeline (e.g., avoid switching from “tested” to “tests” within a section).</li>
            <li><strong>Context Awareness:</strong> Match tense to the document’s purpose, such as using present tense for general truths in literature reviews or future tense for proposed work.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Tense consistency strengthens the clarity and credibility of written work.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
        <h2>4.6 Passive Voice</h2>
        <p>Passive voice emphasizes the action or object rather than the subject, commonly used in academic writing for objectivity but requiring careful application.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Structure:</strong> In passive voice, the subject receives the action (e.g., “The software was updated by the team” vs. active “The team updated the software”).</li>
            <li><strong>Use in Academic Writing:</strong> Common in scientific writing to focus on processes or results (e.g., “The data was analyzed using Python”).</li>
            <li><strong>Limitations:</strong> Overuse can make writing vague or wordy. Use active voice when the subject’s action is critical for clarity (e.g., “The developer fixed the bug”).</li>
            <li><strong>Balancing Voices:</strong> Combine passive and active voice strategically, using passive for objectivity in methods and active for emphasis in conclusions.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Appropriate use of passive voice enhances formality while maintaining focus on key elements in academic texts.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
        <h2>4.7 Transition Words</h2>
        <p>Transition words connect ideas, improve flow, and guide readers through arguments or processes in academic and professional writing.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Additive Transitions:</strong> Words like “furthermore,” “in addition,” or “also” introduce supporting points (e.g., “The system is efficient; furthermore, it reduces costs”).</li>
            <li><strong>Causal Transitions:</strong> Words like “therefore,” “because,” or “consequently” show cause-and-effect relationships (e.g., “The test failed; therefore, adjustments were made”).</li>
            <li><strong>Contrast Transitions:</strong> Words like “however,” “nevertheless,” or “in contrast” highlight differences (e.g., “The old system was slow; however, the new one is optimized”).</li>
            <li><strong>Sequential Transitions:</strong> Words like “firstly,” “next,” or “finally” organize steps or arguments (e.g., “Firstly, the data was collected; next, it was analyzed”).</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Effective use of transition words enhances coherence, making complex technical writing easier to follow.</p>
