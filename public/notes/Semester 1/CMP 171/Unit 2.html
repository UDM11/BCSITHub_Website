    <h1>Unit 2: Computer Hardware</h1>

    <div class="section">
        <h2>2.1 Introduction</h2>
        <p>Computer hardware refers to the physical components of a computer system that can be seen and touched. These components work together to process data, execute instructions, and produce output. Hardware forms the foundation of any computing device, enabling it to perform tasks as directed by software.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Purpose:</strong> Hardware provides the physical infrastructure for data processing, storage, and interaction with users.</li>
            <li><strong>Components:</strong> Key hardware includes the CPU, memory, storage devices, input devices, and output devices.</li>
            <li><strong>Examples:</strong> Common hardware includes processors (e.g., Intel Core), RAM, hard drives, keyboards, and monitors.</li>
        </ul>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
        <h2>2.2 Functional Block Diagram of Digital Computer System</h2>
        <p>A digital computer system is organized into functional units that work together to process data. The block diagram represents the main components: Arithmetic Logic Unit (ALU), Control Unit (CU), Memory Unit, and Input/Output Units, all interconnected to perform computing tasks.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Overview:</strong> The block diagram illustrates how data flows between input, processing, memory, control, and output units.</li>
            <li><strong>Data Flow:</strong> Input units accept data, the ALU and CU process it, memory stores it, and output units display or transmit results.</li>
            <li><strong>Interconnection:</strong> Components communicate via buses (data, address, and control buses) to coordinate operations.</li>
        </ul>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>2.2.1 ALU (Arithmetic Logic Unit)</h2>
            <p>The Arithmetic Logic Unit (ALU) is a core component of the CPU responsible for performing arithmetic and logical operations.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Functions:</strong> Executes arithmetic operations (e.g., addition, subtraction) and logical operations (e.g., AND, OR, NOT).</li>
                <li><strong>Data Processing:</strong> Receives data from registers or memory, processes it, and sends results back for storage or output.</li>
                <li><strong>Examples:</strong> ALUs in modern CPUs, like those in Intel or AMD processors, handle complex calculations at high speeds.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>2.2.2 CU (Control Unit)</h2>
            <p>The Control Unit (CU) directs the operation of the processor, coordinating the activities of other hardware components.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Functions:</strong> Fetches instructions from memory, decodes them, and directs the ALU, memory, and I/O units to execute them.</li>
                <li><strong>Coordination:</strong> Manages the flow of data between the CPU, memory, and I/O devices via control signals.</li>
                <li><strong>Examples:</strong> The CU in a processor ensures that instructions are executed in the correct sequence, such as in a fetch-decode-execute cycle.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>2.2.3 Memory Unit</h2>
            <p>The Memory Unit stores data and instructions temporarily or permanently for processing and retrieval.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Types:</strong> Primary memory (e.g., RAM, ROM) for temporary storage and secondary memory (e.g., HDD, SSD) for long-term storage.</li>
                <li><strong>Functions:</strong> Holds data and instructions being processed by the CPU and stores results for future use.</li>
                <li><strong>Examples:</strong> DDR4 RAM for fast access during processing, and SSDs for reliable, high-capacity storage.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>2.2.4 Input and Output Units</h2>
            <p>Input and Output Units facilitate communication between the computer and the external environment, allowing data entry and result display.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Input Units:</strong> Devices like keyboards, mice, and scanners that allow users to enter data or instructions into the computer.</li>
                <li><strong>Output Units:</strong> Devices like monitors, printers, and speakers that display or produce the results of computations.</li>
                <li><strong>Examples:</strong> A touchscreen serves as both an input (touch gestures) and output (display) device, while a printer outputs hard copies of documents.</li>
            </ul>
