    <h1>Unit 3: Computer Software</h1>

    <div class="section">
        <h2>3.1 Introduction</h2>
        <p>Computer software is a set of instructions or programs that direct a computer to perform specific tasks. It acts as an interface between the hardware and the user, enabling the computer to process data and execute operations. Software is essential for making hardware functional and user-friendly.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Purpose:</strong> Software provides the logic and functionality to control hardware and perform tasks like calculations, communication, or data management.</li>
            <li><strong>Components:</strong> Software includes programs, scripts, and associated data that guide computer operations.</li>
            <li><strong>Examples:</strong> Common software includes operating systems like Windows, applications like Microsoft Word, and utilities like antivirus programs.</li>
        </ul>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
        <h2>3.2 Types of Software</h2>
        <p>Software is broadly classified into two categories: System Software and Application Software. Each type serves distinct purposes in managing computer resources or fulfilling user needs.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>System Software:</strong> Manages and controls hardware resources, providing a platform for other software to run.</li>
            <li><strong>Application Software:</strong> Performs specific tasks for users, such as word processing, browsing, or gaming.</li>
        </ul>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>3.2.1 System Software</h2>
            <p>System software is designed to manage and operate computer hardware, ensuring efficient performance and providing a foundation for application software. It includes programs that control system resources and facilitate software development or management.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Functions:</strong> Manages hardware, provides user interfaces, and supports application execution.</li>
                <li><strong>Examples:</strong> Operating systems (e.g., Linux, Windows), device drivers, and utility programs.</li>
            </ul>

            <div class="section">
                <h2>System Development</h2>
                <p>System development software includes tools used by developers to create, test, and maintain other software applications or systems.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Purpose:</strong> Facilitates coding, debugging, and software deployment.</li>
                    <li><strong>Tools:</strong> Includes compilers, interpreters, and integrated development environments (IDEs).</li>
                    <li><strong>Examples:</strong> Visual Studio, GCC, and Python interpreters.</li>
                </ul>
            </div>

            <div class="section">
                <h2>System Management</h2>
                <p>System management software oversees the operation and maintenance of computer systems, ensuring optimal performance and resource allocation.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Purpose:</strong> Monitors system performance, manages resources, and enhances security.</li>
                    <li><strong>Tools:</strong> Includes operating systems, utilities, and diagnostic tools.</li>
                    <li><strong>Examples:</strong> Windows Task Manager, antivirus software, and disk defragmenters.</li>
                </ul>
            </div>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>3.2.2 Application Software</h2>
            <p>Application software is designed to perform specific user-oriented tasks, ranging from productivity to entertainment. It runs on top of system software and caters to diverse user requirements.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Functions:</strong> Enables users to perform tasks like document creation, data analysis, or media playback.</li>
