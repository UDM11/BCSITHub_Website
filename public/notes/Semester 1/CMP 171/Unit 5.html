    <h1>Unit 5: Data Communication and Computer Network</h1>

    <div class="section">
        <h2>5.1 Introduction</h2>
        <p>Data communication involves the transmission of digital data between two or more devices, while a computer network is a collection of interconnected devices that share resources and communicate with each other. These concepts form the backbone of modern connectivity, enabling information exchange across the globe.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Purpose:</strong> Facilitates data sharing, resource access, and communication between devices.</li>
            <li><strong>Components:</strong> Includes devices (computers, routers), communication media, and protocols.</li>
            <li><strong>Examples:</strong> The Internet, local office networks, and mobile data networks.</li>
        </ul>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
        <h2>5.2 Communication Media</h2>
        <p>Communication media refers to the physical or wireless channels used to transmit data between devices in a network.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Wired Media:</strong> Includes twisted pair cables, coaxial cables, and fiber optic cables, offering reliable and high-speed connections.</li>
            <li><strong>Wireless Media:</strong> Uses radio waves, microwaves, or infrared signals, e.g., Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, and satellite communication.</li>
            <li><strong>Examples:</strong> Ethernet cables for wired connections and Wi-Fi for wireless networks.</li>
        </ul>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
        <h2>5.3 Communication Mode</h2>
        <p>Communication modes describe the direction of data flow between devices in a network.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Simplex:</strong> Data flows in one direction only, e.g., radio broadcasting.</li>
            <li><strong>Half-Duplex:</strong> Data flows in both directions, but not simultaneously, e.g., walkie-talkies.</li>
            <li><strong>Full-Duplex:</strong> Data flows in both directions simultaneously, e.g., telephone conversations or Ethernet connections.</li>
        </ul>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
        <h2>5.4 Computer Network</h2>
        <p>A computer network is a system of interconnected devices that communicate to share resources, data, and applications.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Purpose:</strong> Enables resource sharing, communication, and collaboration among users.</li>
            <li><strong>Components:</strong> Consists of nodes (computers, printers), networking hardware (routers, switches), and protocols.</li>
            <li><strong>Examples:</strong> Local Area Networks (LANs) in offices or Wide Area Networks (WANs) like the Internet.</li>
        </ul>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
        <h2>5.5 Advantage and Disadvantage of Computer Network</h2>
        <p>Computer networks offer numerous benefits but also come with certain challenges.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Advantages:</strong> Facilitates resource sharing (e.g., printers, files), improves communication, and supports centralized data management.</li>
            <li><strong>Disadvantages:</strong> Requires costly setup and maintenance, poses security risks, and may experience network failures.</li>
            <li><strong>Examples:</strong> Sharing a single printer in an office (advantage) or data breaches due to weak security (disadvantage).</li>
        </ul>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
        <h2>5.6 Types of Networks</h2>
        <p>Networks are classified based on their geographical coverage and functionality.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>LAN (Local Area Network):</strong> Covers a small area like an office or home, e.g., Wi-Fi networks.</li>
            <li><strong>WAN (Wide Area Network):</strong> Spans large geographical areas, e.g., the Internet or corporate networks.</li>
            <li><strong>MAN (Metropolitan Area Network):</strong> Covers a city or campus, e.g., city-wide fiber networks.</li>
            <li><strong>PAN (Personal Area Network):</strong> Connects personal devices over short distances, e.g., Bluetooth connections.</li>
        </ul>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
        <h2>5.7 Network Topology</h2>
        <p>Network topology defines the physical or logical arrangement of devices in a network.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Bus Topology:</strong> All devices share a single communication line, simple but prone to failures.</li>
            <li><strong>Star Topology:</strong> Devices connect to a central hub, reliable but dependent on the hub.</li>
            <li><strong>Ring Topology:</strong> Devices form a closed loop, with data circulating in one direction.</li>
            <li><strong>Mesh Topology:</strong> Devices are interconnected, offering redundancy but complex to implement.</li>
        </ul>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
        <h2>5.8 Communication Protocols (IP, TCP)</h2>
        <p>Communication protocols are rules that govern data exchange between devices in a network.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>IP (Internet Protocol):</strong> Assigns unique addresses to devices and routes data packets across networks.</li>
            <li><strong>TCP (Transmission Control Protocol):</strong> Ensures reliable data transmission by managing packet order and error checking.</li>
            <li><strong>Examples:</strong> TCP/IP together enable reliable Internet communication, used in web browsing and email.</li>
        </ul>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
        <h2>5.9 Networking Hardware</h2>
        <p>Networking hardware includes devices that facilitate connectivity and data transfer in a network.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Router:</strong> Directs data between networks, e.g., connecting a LAN to the Internet.</li>
            <li><strong>Switch:</strong> Connects devices within a network, forwarding data to specific destinations.</li>
            <li><strong>Access Point:</strong> Enables wireless connectivity, e.g., Wi-Fi routers.</li>
            <li><strong>Network Interface Card (NIC):</strong> Allows devices to connect to a network, wired or wireless.</li>
